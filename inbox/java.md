- [ ] - according to Oracle documentation, **a `lambda expression` is just a shorter way of writing an implementation of a method for later execution.**
- [ ] - `Stream` is a collection of data that developers can process on in a declarative and functional approach
- [ ] - `Stream` is not data structure. it’s just process the data using method without changing the original data.
- [ ] - *Collections Framework* stores and organizes data in the JVM’s memory, while the *Stream API* serves as an additional framework that aids in efficiently processing the data
- [ ] - *Stream API* facilitates a functional programming approach for handling collections
- [ ] - `Stream` operations execute lazily, improving performance by running only when needed (when `terminal operations` called)
- [ ] - `parallelStream()` method allows streams to take advantage of parallel processing, enabling concurrent execution on multi-core processors
