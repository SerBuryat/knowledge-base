> A **virtual private server** (**VPS**) is a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual machine") sold as a service by an [Internet hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service "Internet hosting service"). The term "**virtual dedicated server**" (**VDS**) also has a similar meaning.
> A virtual private server runs its own copy of an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") (OS), and customers may have [superuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser "Superuser")-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.
