## SMT

> Simultaneous _multithreading_ (_SMT_) is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar CPUs with hardware _multithreading_ - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading)

Hyperthreading is implementation of **==simultaneous multithreading==**.
Possibility to **==divide physical CPU to 2 vCPU working parallel==** *(doing 2 CPU instruction per 1 CPU clock)*.

> *If open 'Windows Task Manager' -> 'Resource monitoring' you can see that, for example, 4 cores CPU has 8 CPU monitoring displays.*
> *Cause every modern CPU has hyperthreading technology*
